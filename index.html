									<p class="p1">
									<p class="p1">The profound sense of loss is purely striking. Loss as a long and slow
										gruelling
										process, there is a timeline in its concept. The interconnected nature of it is
										present across scales – from
										personal to global, from human to non-human, from micro to the planetary – all
										of this makes the loss collective.
										The loss of the loved one, ecological catastrophe – the bodies reach their
										limits. Entanglement occurs when these
										bodies appear intangibly connected to each other and share a sort of same idea.
										Taking a perspective from quantum
										theory, one can even perceive the potential coherence between entities on a
										quantum scale.</p>
									<p class="p2">This thesis explores the notions of matter through historical,
										ecological and political
										perspectives. The microparticles, dust, gas atoms and metals are
										the forms of matter transforming into materials through the process of passive
										accumulation. British
										anthropologist Tim Ingold argues that ‘materials do not exist; in the manner of
										objects, they rather occur, carry
										on, or perdure, through time’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1"
												id="fnref1">[1] </a></sup>Each material, in
										fact, represents a state of becoming—the potential to transform into something
										else. In this context, gas atoms,
										minerals can be seen as a material in the process of being transformed into
										commodity for the productions of
										technologies. Deleuze writes on materiality: 'whenever we encounter matter ‘it
										is matter in movement, in flux, in
										variation’, with the consequence that ‘this matter-flow can only be followed’.
										<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref1">[2]</a></sup>
									<p class="p2">Some non-human dimensions are not accessible to the human eye without
										machine vision.
										Micro-particles exemplify a form of matter that eludes direct visibility.
										Despite their minuscule size, they wield
										power in capital and political competition when they are transformed into
										material. In this thesis, I explore
										layers of visibility and their intersection with the forces of power that
										control them. However, discussing
										visibility inevitably involves addressing its counterpart, obscurity, which I
										examine across its different
										dimensions. What are the invisibilities on micro and planetary scales? When does
										the invisible become
										visible? </p>
									<p class="p2">The materiality of technology consists of the processes of creating
										these technologies
										based on colonial and imperial legacy: as a continuation of the conquest and
										accumulation of land and resources.
										The material composition of technologies includes minerals, metals, gases and
										various elements that are integrated
										into objects. We cannot imagine the future without looking into the past. In the
										first chapter, <i>“Night Blankets
											the Landscape”</i>, I use a 19th-century painting depicting a landscape at
										night as a lens to discuss resource
										extraction, exploitation, and imperial othering of southern-eastern Ukraine. Are
										there ways to trade materials
										without the cover of darkness? What is the materiality of labour and what role
										does it play in the material
										exchange?How does the relationship between technology's materiality and the
										physically
										demanding labour of a region's population lead to their exploitation and
										invisibility, and how does this affect
										the environment, society, and politics in the long term?</p>
									<p class="p2">The second chapter, <i>“Black Snow”,</i> unfolds the story of how
										emissions from
										industrial enterprises on a winter morning in Mariupol, a city in eastern
										Ukraine, resulted in grey-tinted
										surfaces. Where micro-particles remain invisible in everyday situations, their
										presence becomes apparent when they interact with the white snow. Dust particles
										of the
										black snow carry political agency as well as lungs inhale dormant political
										ambition. Their accumulation over time
										inside Earth and bodies becomes a witness to the events that take place on this
										territory.</p>
									<p class="p2">The third chapter <i>“Neon Futures”</i> delves into the political
										power of neon as a
										gas used to produce semi-conductors. It raises the history of investment into
										the manufacturing of this gas in
										south-eastern Ukraine, including the metallurgical plant in Mariupol. Neon
										particles gain their material power as
										a <i>vibrant matter,</i>revealing the workings of power structures – the
										control,
										exploitation and destruction of land in the relentless pursuit of value
										production</p>

									<p class="p1">The moon, the clouds, and the dark distance. The painting by
										Mariupol-born artist Arkhip Kuindzhi depicts an innocent landscape – two shores
										of Ukraine in 1880, before their industrial transformation. In this essay, the
										landscape is not just a painting; it is a lens, a universal medium that
										denaturalizes the representational physicality of nature through the arts.<sup
											class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1-1" id="fnref1-1">[1] </a></sup>I use the
										medium of the landscape to talk about its exploitation, depletion, geopolitical
										and ecological processes that are linked to the materiality of technologies
										produced within this region.</p>
									<p class="p2">An image of a landscape can be defined as a particular tracing of the
										place at a very precise moment in time and history. The image serves as a
										representation of data through a particular form of analysis. The format of the
										landscape image is a classical mode of power that emerges through
										representation. In this case, the establishment of the notion of the territory
										or the landscape emerges through the technique of landscape painting. Everything
										depicted in the painting vanishes into the obscurity of an unstable blend of
										paint and pigments. The artist used aluminium dust to intensify the radiance and
										luminosity of the bright elements: the mood and light reflections. Within the
										mix of dark paints, bitumen or liquid asphalt, darkening with time, obscures the
										details of the landscape.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2-1"
												id="fnref2-1">[2] </a></sup>Over time, the image transforms, gradually
										dissolving into an abstraction of darkness and invisibility. The process of
										pigments fading is intertwined with a historical context that voids the events
										of transformation of the landscape. What persists in invisibility of the
										industrial transformation? What constitutes the material essence of an
										industrial landscape? What is the landscape beyond the industrial
										transformation? How does the material power stay invisible?</p>
									<p class="p2">Art historian Hélène Valence explains how vision and technological
										progress intersect. She argues that nocturnes, or night paintings, serve as a
										response to the increased technological visibility of the age.<sup
											class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3-1" id="fnref3-1">[3] </a></sup>These
										paintings consider two dimensions of visibility—the physically observable and
										that which is within the limits of the day's gaze. Seeking to distance
										themselves from the visibility imposed by technology, the artists found
										inspiration in an alternative, introspective form of vision. In their creations,
										they sought to establish a formal connection with this inward-looking
										perspective, directing their attention to the darkness opened by the remarkable
										discoveries of their time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4-1"
												id="fnref4-1">[4] </a></sup> </p>
									<p class="p2">The transformation of the landscape involves a process of detachment
										and abstraction. Earth undergoes a sorting process, breaking down into minerals
										that eventually turn into refined dust, microparticles. As the landscape
										undergoes these changes, it retains evidence of events that occur within it. The
										discovery of coal and complex ore deposits from Donbas to the Dnipro River led
										to the transformation of this landscape. The demand for minerals from Donbas and
										neighbouring territory has consistently been a direct result of industrial
										developments, making this region’s soil the birthplace of sites of extraction
										and destruction that are actualised in other realities. Mining and
										industrialisation are an attempt to capitalise on the geologically depleted
										planetary body. Metallurgical plants, coal and iron ore mining, chemical and gas
										production like neon, krypton, xenon and helium, (see Neon Futures chapter)
										turned the landscape into a site where resource material was extracted and
										exploited for the purpose of capitalistic market interests and profit.</span>
									</p>
									<p class="p2">The industrialization is supported by specific narratives that
										abstract the landscape and fuel the colonial gaze on the region. </span>
										Cartographically, the territory of south-eastern Ukraine depicted in the night
										painting is a steppe, it is a spacious plain, an ‘empty’ place – a vast field
										for imperial and industrial fantasies. Before the industrial transformation, the
										south-eastern region including Donbas was referred to as the Wild Field or
										“Dikoye Polye” is Russian, it was controlled by Cossaks and nomadic groups. The
										imagination of the land as an empty, lifeless region, is an excuse to ’justify
										settler colonialism and erase local human and non-human histories’ according to
										Darya Tsymbalyuk.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5-1" id="fnref5-1">[5]
											</a></sup>The Ukrainian
										steppe has a vibrant ecology of rare plants, coal, minerals and fossils that
										form an archival memory of the place. It is more than just a mining site,
										presenting the region as a biodiverse and rich ecosystem and challenging the
										reductionist narrative. Victoria Donovan confronts ‘the black myth’ of Donbas,
										which reduces of the region within the cultural imagination to a mere extraction
										resource and component of material exchange.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a
												href="#fn6-1" id="fnref6-1">[6] </a></sup>This process equates the human
										population
										and life at large to geological, agricultural, and other forms of matter with
										usable material capacities. This narrative embodies a form of <i>slow
											violence</i> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7-1" id="fnref7-1">[7]
											</a></sup> and environmental
										damage inflicted on the region, often characterised through the lens of the
										inhuman category.</p>
									<p class="p2">During the 19th century the development of the field of geology in
										imperial nations and geological prospecting were applied in the south-eastern
										regions of Ukraine, establishing the regime of material power. In the second
										half of the 18th century, iron ore deposits were discovered in the Kryvyi Rih
										basin. The coal industry was intensified following the
										identification of the Donetsk coal basin, later known as Donbas, which spans
										the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a
												href="#fn8-1" id="fnref8-1">[8] </a></sup> The discovery of
										coal and iron ore reserves contributed to the significant industrialisation of
										steel production, mainly through investment from European and Russian sources.
										By 1900, a "favourable investment climate" spurred the extensive extraction of
										coal and iron ore, along with the concurrent expansion of metallurgical and
										chemical industries, states Eugene Bersheda, mechanical engineering, and the
										growth of agro-industry in the region<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9-1"
												id="fnref9-1">[9] </a></sup>. Therefore, the Donbas region attracted
										foreign investments from Belgian, Dutch, British, and American industrialists,
										with a primary emphasis on mining activities that generated substantial profits,
										particularly benefiting the elite of the Russian Empire. Ukraine found itself
										subjected to a form of dual colonisation by both Western Europe and the Russian
										Empire, a condition that was further solidified during the Soviet
										era.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10-1" id="fnref10-1">[10] </a></sup>
									<p class="p2">Classical power is often transmitted through landscape painting, and
										Kuindzhi's work serves as a vivid illustration of the assertion of ownership of
										the landscape. The painting, held in the State Russian Museum in St Petersburg,
										itself signifies the authoritative appropriation of territory and reflects the
										colonial attitude toward Ukrainian land. This portrayal ties into Jason W.
										Moore's concept of "<i>peak appropriation</i>", emphasising the historical
										capitalist trends of enclosure and depletion of natural resources: coal seams,
										oil fields, aquifers and peasantries. Moore contends that the key issue faced by
										capital today is not abstract depletion but the diminishing opportunities to
										appropriate nature cheaply.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11-1"
												id="fnref11-1">[11] </a></p>
									<p class="p2">In addition to the Earth’s material, the human labour of the region’s
										population also participates in the material exchange. Materiality of
										technologies and immateriality of hard and physically exhausting labour are
										interlaced. Miners, factory workers, and employees of enterprises embody the
										tangible aspect, often reduced to mere instruments of production, living
										material or inhuman subject. For decades, the West Europeans and Russians have
										rendered Ukrainians as inexpensive labour, the resource — the bodies sustaining
										the environmental impact of their industries, exhausted by work-related
										injuries, the bodies whose cancer rates dictated by others’ business interests.
										These bodies are the buffer zone, the production site, a population whose voice
										is muted or falsified by political power. They are ‘invisible’ bodies belonging
										to inhuman category. Bodies in which the dust of industrialisation settles,
										which are now forced to migrate. They are not present in the landscape, both in
										the picture and in the deserted, ruined land.</p>
									<p class="p2">Power over bodies can be invisible when these bodies are absorbed into
										the system that defines their existence. When power becomes embedded in everyday
										life, each subject becomes an auxiliary element of its functioning and stops
										noticing the violence over the body. It is an unconscious norm; all actions are
										predetermined. For those who are held hostage, there is no alternative, no
										possibility of imagining something else.</p>
									<p class="p2">Now the landscape transformed into post-industrial, empty site
										reclaiming the space abandoned by people after mining operations have ceased
										because of the invasion of the region by Russian Federation. This space is
										marked by dust, rocks, mines, destruction, entropy and the will to resist it—the
										will to pull and grasp something that is continually dissipating. The
										destruction, ecological damage and war invented the longing and distance – the
										unknowability of the day we might return, and the world will return to the point
										when there was no ‘before’. The imperial ambitions of Soviet Union and
										Post-Soviet Russia shrink cities remaining abolishment and destruction on the
										south-eastern Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and sights. The
										occupation and exploitation of the territories, soils, mineral deposits, and
										populations into material between colonial powers fostered regimes of material
										power that still present today.</p>

									<p class="p1">Black snow has fallen in the Donbas every winter, though the first
										officially documented occurrence dates back to January 21, 2009. It emerged on a
										morning in the industrial region in various cities of Eastern Ukraine: Mariupol,
										Kramatorsk and Donetsk. It has no taste or smell, its flakes do not weigh much,
										they cannot be embraced or counted. You can't grab them with your hands, you
										can't feel them tactilely. Black snow’s presence only discernible through its
										interaction with the white snow or the bright light otherwise remaining
										imperceptible.
									</p>
									<p class="p2">This essay is about black snow as a metaphor for the impact of
										industrialisation, post-industrialisation and depletion as an attempt to
										capitalise the planetary body. The physical extraction of resources in the
										regions of Donbas through industrial production, colonial mechanisms combined
										with the conceptualisation of the region as a site of extraction and has led to
										the <i>resourcification</i> of the territory. In this essay, I use black snow to
										talk about the <i>media materiality</i>, components used to produce contemporary
										technologies, in this case the neon gas produced on the steel factory. The black
										snow in Mariupol witnessed a collision of environmental violence and geopolitics
										resulting in humanitarian and ecological catastrophe.</p>
									<p class="p2">Black snow particles are everywhere forming unseen and unheard
										colonies. These obscure snowflakes coats artifacts, covering landscapes and
										memories. It settles into the body, leaving an intangible presence expressed in
										its gradual transformation. Black snow reflects the temporary nature of
										matter—it may gather in sludge over time, turn into a solid, freeze into ice, or
										melt into water. Black snow operates through the effect of <i>slow violence,</i>
										instantly unseen, gradual process of degradation. It occurs in the passive voice
										in long term durations and <i>deep time </i>of geopolitics.
									</p>
									<p class="p2">Methods by which metals are extracted for heavy metal products
										bridges, spaceships, armour for tanks as well as metals for technologies such as
										chips, circuit boards, including motherboards are very harmful for the workforce
										due to the fumes emitted during their burning and melting. Mariupol has
										perpetually been overshadowed by a distant black cloud, a consequence of
										emissions from a local steel plant's blast furnace. The dense clouds of toxic
										ash that ascend into the sky includes sulfur antihydrogen, nitrogen oxides,
										carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, lead, phenol, ammonia, soot, toxic oxides of
										iron, silicon, aluminium, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, chromium, calcium
										compounds<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1-2" id="fnref1-2">[1]
											</a></sup>. Originating as a
										byproduct of the steel and iron industry, these materials are composed of iron
										and carbon with others additives such as nickel, chromium, vanadium, tungsten
										and manganese. Within Mariupol (as of 2007) there are areas of the territory,
										the soils of which contain significantly higher than average concentrations of
										heavy metals in the region: manganese, chromium, lead, zinc, copper and
										mercury.</p>
									<p class="p2">Since the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine in 2014, a persistent
										black cloud has loomed over Donbas, darkening the sky with smog. This cloud is
										composed of trace amounts of carbon black particles and aluminium dust resulting
										from combustion of missile fuel. In May 2022, the Russian army levelled
										Azovstal, the steel and iron plant, reducing it to a ghost composed of black
										soot. This dust has contributed to a new layer on the soil, combining remnants
										from the plant's exhaust, mining, missile emissions, chemical weapons, and the
										charred remnants of the factory. These particles seep deep into the ground,
										contaminating the water and accumulating in deposits, turning the Earth into an
										archival witness to these violations. As snow blankets the landscape on winter
										mornings, it conceals the evidence of these events, blending with the existing
										black material deposits.</p>
									<p class="p2">The presence of the iron and steel industry and mining activities in
										the region leaves a noticeable imprint in the air, materialising as dust
										settling on surfaces and permeating bodies. Black snow serves as a memory
										archive, documenting events and transforming both the environment and bodies
										into artifacts. Black snow gains material significance when it has a physical
										effect and transformation of bodies. The artist-researcher Susan Schuppli has
										coined the term ‘material witness’ to refer to those materials that might serve
										as witnesses to violent acts or catastrophes that have happened in the past, and
										whose consequences continue to unfold<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2-2"
												id="fnref2-2">[2]
											</a></sup>. Settling on the surface, the snow records
										evidence of the post-industrial black chemical deposits. Bodies affected by
										black snow disrupt the conventional passage of time, embodying its destructive
										impact as a form of memory and witness.</p>
									<p class="p2">The air of technological and industrial culture is one that is heavy
										with metals and chemicals. Metals form the infrastructure of societies, the
										bodies and technologies. We exist within metallic naturecultures according to
										Donna Haraway’s term, and our bodies are “walking, talking minerals”
										<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3-2" id="fnref3-2">[3]
											</a></sup>quoting Vladimir Vernadsky, a
										founder and first president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.
										Although black snow is not graspable, it is a
										tangible material consisting of toxic metal and chemical elements that, like the
										air we breathe, is gaseous. Human bodies absorbing toxic exhausts are
										unwittingly part of inscription systems: they register the materiality of
										technology production. The effect of the toxic emissions settles down in lungs,
										brains, nervous systems, and more. For example, hexavalent Chromium/Chromium VI
										discharged at production facilities passes through cell membranes, causing a
										variety of toxic effects in contaminated cells. The emissions of lead damages
										the central and peripheral nervous systems, blood systems, kidney and
										reproductive system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4-2" id="fnref4-2">[4]
											</a></sup>Mercury
										affects the brain and kidneys, as the foetus in pregnant women.
									</p>
									<p class="p2">Take a deep breath, exhale. The lack of air resulting from an
										accumulation of black particles signifies the material depletion of nature's
										bodies. Micro-particles of metals and chemicals cannot be detectable by the
										human eye, but they are equally not entirely invisible—often, microscopes are
										needed to see them. Image technologies are the prothesis here to our human eye.
										Black dust conveys its materiality through its impact on the natural environment
										and human bodies. An effect of slow violent progression makes the black dust
										visible. Black snow is a phenomenon that unravels invisible, making the
										imperceptible tangible.</p>

									<p class="p1">The measurement of time's progression is marked by сhaos. The future
										is comparable to gas, where in the vastness of time every movement entails
										decay. Entropy permeates meaning which may not endure. Flemish chemist and
										alchemist Jan Baptist van Helmont in the 16th century, coined the term
										“<i>gas</i>", a neologism intentionally referring to “<i>chaos”</i>, both
										pronounced similarly in Dutch<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1-3" id="fnref1-3">[1]
										</a></sup>. Neon
										is crystallized chaos and embodies this connection. In this colourless and
										odourless noble gas, ecology, technology, and its material essence come
										together. Originating as a byproduct of steel production in the southeastern
										Ukraine region, neon plays a crucial role in the supply chain for contemporary
										microchip production. I ask: what is the (geo-)political capacity of neon as a
										material?</p>
									<p class="p2">Under normal conditions, neon gas is colourless and remains invisible
										to the human eye. However, when electricity is applied, it exhibits a bright
										red-orange glow. Neon's inherent invisibility intersects with the power dynamics
										of politics. The translation from invisibility to visibility prompts questions
										about what other forms of visibility might be constructed as layers of control
										within material production. How does the invisible transition into visible? For
										whom does it remain invisible, and on which layer does invisibility
										persist?</p>
									<p class="p2">In October 1986, amid Cold War tensions, Gorbachev and Reagan met in
										Reykjavik to discuss the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) – also known as
										Reagan’s ‘Star Wars’ programme – wrestling with the decision to eliminate
										nuclear weapons. Despite shared aspirations for disarmament, their summit
										meeting reached a critical impasse over Gorbachev's insistence that SDI “be
										confined to research and testing to the laboratories” preventing a historic
										breakthrough.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2-3" id="fnref2-3">[2]
										</a></sup> Gorbachev went back
										to Moscow, convinced that all things 'Star Wars' were the future of great power
										competition. He strategically invested in the production of materials such as
										neon, crucial to the supply chain for the manufacturing of the future giant
										space laser capable of destroying certain targets. A few years later The Soviet
										Union collapsed, but the neon infrastructure in southern Ukraine and Russia
										remained.</p>
									<p class="p2">Today, neon has found other uses in technology, in the supply chain
										for the microchip production used in phones, computers, servers and cars making
										it a crucial material for the microchipped technological society. Neon emerged
										as a key element used to focus the apertures of the excimer lasers, facilitating
										semiconductor lithography. In the argon-krypton lasers required for today's
										widely used 14 nm chip architecture, neon, which makes up 95% of the gas mixture
										inside the laser.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3-3" id="fnref3-3">[3]
										</a></sup> Neon production
										is limited to air separation plants, and due to its low concentration, economic
										recovery is feasible only in significant steel plants. The production process
										involves a two-step process: the initial phase in Southern Russian steel
										foundries and the subsequent phase in Odessa and Mariupol. Due to sanctions,
										Russian aggression against Ukraine and the destruction of Azovstal, the steel
										and iron plant in Mariupol in 2022, 80% of the global neon supply is lost. The
										remaining 20% of global neon is sourced from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4-3" id="fnref4-3">[4]
										</a></sup>Peter Zeihan brought his point of view on
										the uncertain future of micro-chips in his lecture “The Future of Global Energy
										At The Edge Of Disorder”. He states that the imminent shortage of a crucial gas
										in the global chip industry could potentially strand the sector, prompting
										upcoming decisions regarding chip prioritization.</p>
									<p class="p2">The shift from an industrial to a service-oriented, technological
										society brings about the emergence of new power sources. Investing in strategic
										sites that produce the materials essential for digital culture signifies the
										rise of novel sources of influence. When neon is in shortage, geopolitics
										undergoes a heightened emotive state, with the West and China competing for a
										material source for prioritization in chip manufacturing. The high end of which
										is used for servers and computers produced in the West, and the low end
										performing simple yes-no equations, produced in China.
										<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5-3" id="fnref5-3">[5]
										</a></sup> The US is trying to restrict China in the
										production of high- and mid-end chips by announcing sanctions in the supply of
										other components in this complex chain. Netherlands joins sanctions by
										cancelling shipments of some of lithography machines to China produced by
										ASML.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6-3" id="fnref6-3">[6]
										</a></sup> Microchips are the physical
										form of globalization; the process of its creation is complex: material
										sourcing, lithography, manufacturing and design takes place in different
										locations all over the world. If you take one player out of the story,
										everything falls apart and we are stuck in a crisis.</p>
									<p class="p2">The chain of materials breaks down into individual links, each holding
										its own measure of political power. Both non-human and human bodies share common
										features and, according to Jane Bennett, political power on different scales is
										inherent in both. In her book "Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things,"
										she argues that non-human entities, including materials, embody a vitality
										capable of influencing both human and political life<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7-3" id="fnref7-3">[7]
										</a></sup>. The political capacity of
										neon, as a vibrant material, influences a power dynamic rooted in material
										exchange for production of technologies. The human conception of power controls
										certain layers of visibility revealing the interaction between both human and
										non-human elements showing their capacity in matter. Hidden infrastructures
										operate on various scales, much like power: from global to individual, from
										political to environmental systems, the lack of visibility and chaos are common
										aspects present in both. Visibility can be understood as an ability to see,
										visibilities are the layers of control, the matter of political urgency.
										Invisibility becomes a political tool in the escalation of military weaponry,
										disinformation in the media, and the ecological crises. The digital environment
										where the world is currently visualized provides the vision of control, power
										and profit. The material aspect of technologies makes some digital visibilities
										technically possible, thus having control over these visibilities. Those who
										control the material also control visibility.</p>
									<p class="p2">The economic model and political tension refuses to acknowledge their
										devastating powers that turned the landscape into ruins. In “Entropy Made
										Visible”, Smithson states that mining industry's neglect for the post-operation
										state of a landscape reflects "a sort of blindness." In case of southern-eastern
										Ukraine, including the Donbas region, part of which has been occupied since 2014
										by the Russian Federation and is inaccessible due to ongoing military operations
										in the region, the data on the occupied mines and plants and other sources of
										material origin are hidden by the occupier, and therefore removed from public
										visibility. Data from the occupied territories is invisible to politics when the
										occupier refuses to acknowledge the damage and consequences.
									</p>
									<p class="p2">On the contrary, the vision of the ecological state of the landscape
										is currently accessible thought the lens of military operations and drone
										vision. The video reports taken by drone and published by researchers, Ukrainian
										military groups and the Ministry of Internal Affairs witness the crimes against
										humanity, displaying violations happening on the apocalyptic post-industrial
										landscape. The landscape is still the lens accessible through the drone vision.
										Can we still recognise it as we saw it in the night painting? These images are
										visible to perception, the operational drone images become symbolic and refined
										objects in the collective memory within timeless perspective.<br>
									</p>
									<p class="p2">***</p>
									<p class="p2">The material visibility includes the complex chain of processes of its
										creation including mining, production and transportation. By going through this
										complex process, the material gains political power. Neon atoms are comparable
										to political entities entangled in entropy. On a non-human scale, the
										quantum-classical dynamics of neon atoms is an invisible reality as the
										processes of material production controlled by political forces. Nevertheless,
										the lack of direct vision is compensated by knowledge of fundaments of basic
										physics, allowing us to predict and anticipate on different scales: from micro
										to global. Similar to the predictable movements in the dynamics of gases,
										political mechanisms share some calculable patterns. Entropy is the metric for
										the progression of time, the chaos intensifies as we move forward.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8-3" id="fnref8-3">[8]
										</a></sup> “We orbit in groundless space” is
										proclaimed in <i>Chaos Theory</i> by Metahaven. This space is characterized by
										the lack of agency, with uncertainty defining the state of todayness.</span></p>

								<p class="p1">The interplay between microchip technologies, political dynamics and
									imperial ambitions prevents us from better understanding the materiality of these
									technologies and penetrating the power dynamic that creates layers of controlled
									visibilities. Today we must come to terms with the relative lack of power in the
									face of obscured systems. This essay surveys the landscape of the south-eastern
									Ukraine thought the lens of past, post-industrial present and service-oriented
									future. It is marked by the impact of colonialism on the landscape and its
									inhabitants thought the lens of a matter as a resource.
									The landscape breaking down into minerals turned into dust, micro particles of black
									snow and neon gas – the matter characterising the place thought the material
									prospective: imperial gase, exploitation, ecological damage, destruction and war.
