						This research navigates the intersections of media materialism, ecological challenges, and
						geopolitical dynamics through an exploration of the resources embedded in contemporary technologies
						sourced from the South-Eastern region of Ukraine. The narrative unfolds through 3 stories touching
						upon the geological aspect of media and its material essence. This revelation is mirrored in the
						visual essay, where the absence of visibility and reachability is portrayed through obscurity of
						images originating from the region.

					<p class="p1">The moon, the clouds, and the dark distance<span class="s2">. The </span>painting by
						Mariupol-born
						artist Arkhip Kuindzhi depicts an innocent landscape–the two shores of Ukraine in 1880, before
						its
						industrial
						transformation. In this essay, landscape is not just a painting, it is a lens, it is a universal
						medium,
						denaturalisation representational physicality of nature and its representation through the arts
						lens. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> I use the medium of the
						landscape to talk about its exploitation, depletion, geopolitical
						and ecological processes that are linked to the materiality of technologies produced within this
						region.</p>
					<p class="p2">An image of a landscape can be defined as a particular tracing of the place and
						history.
						The image
						serves as a representation of data through a particular form of analysis. Landscape image is a
						classical mode of
						power that emerges through representation. In thus case, the establishment of the notion of the
						territory or the
						landscape emerges by way of the technics of landscape painting. <span class="s1">Everything
							depicted
							in the painting
							vanishes into the obscurity of an unstable blend of paint and pigments. The artist used
							aluminum
							dust to intensify
							the radiance and luminosity, while bitumen or liquid asphalt, darkening with time, obscures
							the
							depicted details
							<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Over time, the image
							transforms gradually
							dissolving into an
							abstraction of darkness and invisibility. The process of pigment fading is intertwined with
							a
							historical context
							that voids the events of transformation of the landscape. What remains obscured </span><span
							class="s2">within the
							framework of landscape industrial transformation? </span><span class="s1">What persists in
							invisibility? What
							constitutes the material essence of an industrial landscape? What is the landscape beyond
							the
							industrial
							transformation?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
					<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Art historian Hélène Valence explains how vision and technological
							progress intersect.
							She argues that nocturnes, or night paintings, serve as a response to the increased
							technological visibility of
							the age. These works consider two dimensions of visibility—the physically observable and
							that
							which is within the
							limits of the day's gaze. Seeking to distance themselves from the visibility imposed by
							technology, the artists
							found inspiration in an alternative, introspective form of vision. In their creations, they
							sought to establish a
							formal connection with this inward-looking perspective, directing their attention to the
							darkness opened up by the
							remarkable discoveries of their time. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3"
									id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.
							<p class="p2">The discovery of coal and complex ores deposits from Donbas to the Dnipro
								river led to the
								transformation of this landscape. The demand for the minerals from Donbas and
								neighbouring territory
								has
								consistently been a direct result of industrial developments, making this region soil
								the birthplace
								of site of
								extraction and destruction that are actualised in other realities. <span
									class="s1">Mining and
									industrialisation are
									an attempt to capitalise on the geologically depleted planetary body.</span>
								Metallurgical
								plants, chemical
								production, and mining of rare materials, including noble gases like neon<span
									class="s2">, krypton,
									xenon and
									helium, (</span>see Neon Futures chapter) turned the landscape into the resource
								material <span class="s4">extracted and exploited for capitalistic profit.</span></p>
							<p class="p2">The transformation of the landscape involves a process of detachment and
								abstraction.
								Earth undergoes a
								sorting process, breaking down into minerals that eventually turn into refined dust. As
								the
								landscape undergoes
								these changes, it retains evidence of events that occur within it. ‘The black myth’ of
								Donbas
								encapsulates the
								reduction of the region within the cultural imagination to a mere extraction resource
								and<span class="s1"> component
									of material exchange<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4"
											id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. This process equates
									the human population
									and life at large to geological, agricultural, and other forms of matter with usable
									material
									capacities</span>.
								This reduction embodies a form of <i>slow violence</i> and environmental damage
								inflicted on the
								region, often
								characterised through the lens of the inhuman category.<span
									class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
							</p>
							<p class="p2">During the 19th century dev<span class="s1">Delopment of the field of geology
									in imperial
									nations,
									geological prospecting initiated in the southeast regions of Ukraine. This, in turn,
									catalysed
									significant
									industrialisation processes primarily fuelled by European and Russian investments,
									coinciding
									with the advent of
									"steel fever." By 1900, a "favorable investment climate" spurred the extensive
									extraction of
									coal and iron ore,
									along with the concurrent expansion of metallurgical and chemical industries,
									mechanical
									engineering, and the
									growth of agro-industry in the region<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5"
											id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. Therefore, Donbas attracted investments from
									Belgian, Dutch,
									British, and American industrialists, with a primary emphasis on mining activities
									that generated
									substantial
									profits, particularly benefiting the elite of the Russian Empire. Ukraine found
									itself subjected to
									a form of dual
									colonisation by both Western Europe and the Russian Empire, a condition that was
									further solidified
									during the
									Soviet era.<span class="s5">[6]</span></p>
							<p class="p2"><span class="s7">Classical power is often transmitted through landscape
									painting, and
									Kuindzhi's work
									serves as a vivid illustration of the assertion of ownership of the landscape. The
									painting,
									held i</span>n the
								State Russian Museum in St Petersburg, itself signifies the authoritative appropriation
								of territory
								and reflects
								the colonial attitude toward Ukrainian land. This portrayal ties into Jason W. Moore's
								concept of
								"<i>peak
									appropriation</i>," emphasising the historical capitalist trends of enclosure and
								depletion of
								natural resources.
								Moore contends that the key issue faced by capital today is not abstract depletion but
								the
								diminishing opportunities
								to appropriate nature inexpensively. T<span class="s1">his idea encapsulates </span>"the
								long
								history of enclosure
								and exhaustion of coal seams, oil fields, aquifers, and peasantries across the space and
								time of
								historical
								capitalism. In this light, the chief problem is not 'peak everything' but peak
								<i>appropriation</i>.
								Capital's
								problem today is not depletion in the abstract but the contracting opportunities to
								appropriate
								nature cheaply."
								[7].<span class="s1"> </span><span class="s8">The intertwining of the materiality of
									work and the
									eternal nature of
									the Earth's materiality encompasses processes such as photosynthesis, the use of
									fossil fuels
									and the contemporary
									importance of rare earth minerals.</span><span class="s5">[8]</span><span
									class="s8"> These
									elements serve both as
									reminders of geological time scales and as essential components mined for the
									development of
									technology.</span>
							</p>
							<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the Earth’s material, the human labour of the
									region’s
									population also
									participates in t</span>he material exchange. Materiality of technologies and
								immateriality of
								hard and physically
								exhausting labour are intertwined. Miners, factory workers, and employees of enterprises
								embody the
								tangible aspect,
								often reduced to mere instruments of production, living material or inhuman subject. For
								decades,
								the West Europeans
								and Russians have rendered Ukrainians as inexpensive labour, the resource — the bodies
								sustaining
								the environmental
								impact of their industries, exhausted by work-related injuries, the bodies whose cancer
								rates
								dictated by others’
								business interests. These bodies are the buffer zone, the production site, a population
								whose voice
								is muted or
								falsified by political power. They are ‘invisible’ bodies belonging to inhuman category.
								Bodies in
								which the dust of
								industrialisation settles, which are now forced to migrate. They are not present in the
								landscape,
								both in the
								picture and in the deserted, ruined land. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
							</p>
							<p class="p2">Now this landscape transformed into post-industrial, empty site reclaiming the
								space
								abandoned by people
								after mining operations have ceased. This space is marked by dust, rocks, mines,
								destruction,
								entropy and the will
								to resist it—the will to pull and grasp something that is continually dissipating: the
								unknowability
								of the day we
								might return and the world will return to the point when there was no ‘before’. The
								destruction and
								war invented the
								longing and distance within us. It is invisible feeling, <span class="s1">yet it weighs
									like a
									massive rock hewn
									from beneath the earth.</span> This rock, created from the accumulation of settled
								dust in the
								lungs, holds
								memories akin to the way the Earth captures and remembers events that occur on it.
