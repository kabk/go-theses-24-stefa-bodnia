									<p class="p1">The profound sense of loss is purely striking. Loss as a long and slow
										gruelling process, there is a timeline in its concept. The interconnected nature
										of
										it is present across scales – from personal to global, from human to non-human,
										from
										micro to the planetary – all of this makes the loss collective. The loss of the
										loved one, ecological catastrophe – the bodies reach their limits. Entanglement
										occurs when these bodies appear intangibly connected to each other and share a
										sort
										of same idea. Taking a perspective from quantum theory, one can even perceive
										the
										potential coherence between entities on a quantum scale.</span></p>
									<p class="p2">In this research I explore notions of matter through
										historical, ecological and political perspectives. The micro-particles, dust,
										gas atoms and metals are the forms of matter transforming into materials through
										the process of passive accumulation. Tim Ingold argues that ‘materials do not
										exist; in the manner of objects, they rather occur, carry on, or perdure,
										through time’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
										Each material, in fact, represents a state of becoming—the potential to
										transform into something else. In this context, gas atoms, minerals can be seen
										as a material in the process of being transformed into commodity for the
										productions of technologies. Deleuze writes on materiality: 'whenever we
										encounter matter ‘it is matter in movement, in flux, in variation’, with the
										consequence that ‘this matter-flow can only be followed’.<sup
											class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref1">[]</a></sup>
									<p class="p2">Non-human dimensions are not accessible to the human eye
										without machine vision. Micro-particles are not directly visible matter. Despite
										their minuscule size, they wield power in capital and political competition when
										they are transformed into material. In this essay, I talk about layers of
										visibility and their intersection with the forces of power that control them.
										Obscurity is the core element of this essay; I consider it through its different
										dimensions. What are the invisibilities on micro and planetary scale? When does
										invisible become visible?
									<p class="p2">The materiality of technology consists of the processes
										of creating these technologies based on colonial and imperial legacy: as a
										continuation of the conquest and accumulation of the land and resources. The
										material composition of technologies includes minerals, metals, gases and
										various elements that are integrated into objects. We cannot imagine the future
										without looking into past. In the first chapter, <i>“Night Blankets the
											Landscape”</i>, I use a night painting of an 18<sup>th</sup> century of
										landscape as a lens to talk about resource extraction, exploitation and imperial
										othering on the territory of southern-eastern Ukraine. Are there ways to trade
										materials without the cover of darkness? What is the materiality of labor and
										what role does it play in the material exchange?</span><span class="s3"> How
											does the relationship between technology's materiality and physically
											demanding
											labor of a region's population lead to their exploitation and invisibility,
											and
											how does this affect the environment, society, and politics in the long
											term?</span></p>
									<p class="p2">The second chapter, “<i>Black snow”,</i> unfolds the
										story of how emissions from industrial enterprises on a winter morning in
										Mariupol, a city in eastern Ukraine, resulted in grey-tinted surfaces. Where
										micro-particles remain invisible in everyday situations, their presence
										</span><span class="s3">becomes apparent when they interact with the white snow.
											Dust particles of the black snow carry political agency as
											lungs inhale dormant political ambition. Their accumulation over time inside
											Earth and bodies becomes a witness to the events that take place on this
											territory.
											<p class="p2">The third chapter “<i>Neon Futures”</i> delves into the
												political power of neon as a gas used for the production of
												semi-conductors. It
												raises the history of investment into the production of this gas in
												south-eastern Ukraine, including the metallurgical plant in Mariupol.
												Neon
												particles gain their material power as a <i>vibrant matter</i>,
												revealing the workings of power structures – the control,
												exploitation and destruction of land in the relentless pursuit of value
												production.

													that
													which is within the

														concept of
														"<i>peak
															appropriation</i>," emphasising the historical capitalist
														trends of
														enclosure and
														depletion of
														natural resources.
														Moore contends that the key issue faced by capital today is not

														depletion but
														the
														diminishing opportunities

															encapsulates
														</span>"the

														historical
														capitalism. In this light, the chief problem is not 'peak
														everything' but
														peak
														<i>appropriation</i>.
														Capital's

														nature cheaply."

													</p>
													<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the Earth’s material,
															the human
															labour of the

														enterprises
														embody the
														tangible aspect,
														often reduced to mere instruments of production, living material

														subject. For
														decades,
														the West Europeans
														and Russians have rendered Ukrainians as inexpensive labour, the
														resource —
														the bodies
														sustaining
														the environmental
														impact of their industries, exhausted by work-related injuries,
														the bodies
														whose cancer
														rates

														business interests. These bodies are the buffer zone, the
														production site, a
														population
														whose voice
														is muted or

														belonging to
														inhuman category.
														Bodies in

													<p class="p2">Now this landscape transformed into post-industrial,

									<p class="p1">The moon, the clouds, and the dark distance<span class="s2">. The
										</span>painting by
										Mariupol-born
										artist Arkhip Kuindzhi depicts an innocent landscape–the two shores of Ukraine
										in
										1880, before
										its
										industrial
										transformation. In this essay, landscape is not just a painting, it is a lens,
										it is
										a universal
										medium,
										denaturalisation representational physicality of nature and its representation
										through the arts
										lens. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> I use
										the
										medium of the
										landscape to talk about its exploitation, depletion, geopolitical
										and ecological processes that are linked to the materiality of technologies
										produced
										within this
										region.</p>
									<p class="p2">An image of a landscape can be defined as a particular tracing of the
										place and
										history.
										The image
										serves as a representation of data through a particular form of analysis.
										Landscape
										image is a
										classical mode of
										power that emerges through representation. In thus case, the establishment of
										the
										notion of the
										territory or the
										landscape emerges by way of the technics of landscape painting. <span
											class="s1">Everything
											depicted
											in the painting
											vanishes into the obscurity of an unstable blend of paint and pigments. The
											artist used
											aluminum
											dust to intensify
											the radiance and luminosity, while bitumen or liquid asphalt, darkening with
											time, obscures
											the
											depicted details
											<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Over
											time,
											the image
											transforms gradually
											dissolving into an
											abstraction of darkness and invisibility. The process of pigment fading is
											intertwined with
											a
											historical context
											that voids the events of transformation of the landscape. What remains
											obscured
											within the
											framework of landscape industrial transformation? </span><span
											class="s1">What
											persists in
											invisibility? What
											constitutes the material essence of an industrial landscape? What is the
											landscape beyond
											the
											industrial
											transformation?
											<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Art historian Hélène Valence explains how
													vision and
													technological
													progress intersect.
													She argues that nocturnes, or night paintings, serve as a response
													to the
													increased
													technological visibility of
													the age. These works consider two dimensions of visibility—the
													physically
													observable and
													that
													which is within the
													limits of the day's gaze. Seeking to distance themselves from the
													visibility
													imposed by
													technology, the artists
													found inspiration in an alternative, introspective form of vision.
													In their
													creations, they
													sought to establish a
													formal connection with this inward-looking perspective, directing
													their
													attention to the
													darkness opened up by the
													remarkable discoveries of their time. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a
															href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.
													<p class="p2">The discovery of coal and complex ores deposits from
														Donbas to the
														Dnipro
														river led to the
														transformation of this landscape. The demand for the minerals
														from Donbas
														and
														neighbouring territory
														has
														consistently been a direct result of industrial developments,
														making this
														region soil
														the birthplace
														of site of
														extraction and destruction that are actualised in other
														realities. <span class="s1">Mining and
															industrialisation are
															an attempt to capitalise on the geologically depleted
															planetary
															body.</span>
														Metallurgical
														plants, chemical
														production, and mining of rare materials, including noble gases
														like
														neon<span class="s2">, krypton,
															xenon and
															helium, (</span>see Neon Futures chapter) turned the
														landscape into the
														resource
														material <span class="s4">extracted and exploited for
															capitalistic
															profit.</span></p>
													<p class="p2">The transformation of the landscape involves a process
														of
														detachment and
														abstraction.
														Earth undergoes a
														sorting process, breaking down into minerals that eventually
														turn into
														refined dust. As
														the
														landscape undergoes
														these changes, it retains evidence of events that occur within
														it. ‘The
														black myth’ of
														Donbas
														encapsulates the
														reduction of the region within the cultural imagination to a
														mere extraction
														resource
														and<span class="s1"> component
															of material exchange<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4"
																	id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. This process equates
															the human population
															and life at large to geological, agricultural, and other
															forms of matter
															with usable
															material
															capacities</span>.
														This reduction embodies a form of <i>slow violence</i> and
														environmental
														damage
														inflicted on the
														region, often
														characterised through the lens of the inhuman category.<span

													<p class="p2">During the 19th century dev<span class="s1">Delopment

							<section class="text">

									<p class="p1">The interplay between microchip technologies, political dynamics and imperial ambitions prevents us from better understanding the materiality of these technologies and penetrating the power dynamic that creates layers of controlled visibilities. Today we must come to terms with the relative lack of power in the face of obscured systems. This essay surveys the landscape of the south-eastern Ukraine thought the lens of past, post-industrial present and service-oriented future. It is marked by the impact of colonialism on the landscape and its inhabitants thought the lens of a matter as a resource.
										The landscape breaking down into minerals turned into dust, micro particles of black snow and neon gas – the matter characterising the place thought the material prospective: imperial gase, exploitation, ecological damage, destruction and war.
